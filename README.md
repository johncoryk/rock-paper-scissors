Rock, paper, scissors game assigned by The Odin Project.

10.27.19

I had a lot of fun making this game! It's by far the most challenging and involved coding project I've done up to this point, and I'll admit, I did have to loosely follow a tutorial online to get through it. Though it wasn't completely "out of my head" I learned a lot, which is why it was assigned (I'm assuming).

I went back in and challenged myself to create a reset button from scratch, I'm proud to say it works exactly how I planned for it to. It's very true that making your own projects is the best way to learn this type of skill (html, css, js, etc). I'm already seeing myself improve!

Thanks for reading, I may update the color palette and icons later on this project.
